## Hi there ðŸ‘‹






### ðŸ¤” ABOUT ME?
Web programming, my spare time friend
I do not know why! But I was attracted to him. I started learning website programming at the age of 28.
html5, css3, javascript and installing WordPress templates and then php - for WordPress plugins and templates.
All this is interesting, but when I got acquainted with the React framework, I decided to become a front-end worker and continue programming the website professionally.
