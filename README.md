## Hi there 👋

### 🤔 ABOUT ME?
Web programming, my spare time friend! <br />
I'm a novice frontend developer. <br/>
I don't know the reason! But I was attracted to programming. I started learning website programming at the age of 28.<br/>
html5, css3, javascript and install wordpress themes and then php - for wordpress plugins and themes.
All this was interesting, but when I got to know the React framework, I decided to become a front-end developer and continue to develop websites professionally.
